The not-quite-1 million questions


LOG-IN / REGISTRATION
Do you want students to log in to the answersheet via boomyeah?
	SEPARATE LOG-IN PAGE

If not, would students be added by instructors/admin (presumably using the same e-mail and password as for bodingdojo.boomyeah.com) or would they register themselves the first time (& registration via the registration/log-in page would default to student as user_level to set permissions)?
	ADDED BY ADMIN/INSTRUCTORS


SCHEDULE
To what extent should I assume a permanent 9-week, 5-days/week format & code that in versus allowing for creater flexbility (but requiring set-up of # of weeks, etc. for each new cohort)?
	9&5

LOCATIONS
Set up with different location possibilities -- Mountain View. Seattle? Others?


PERMISSIONS
For User Levels I was thinking three
1 - Student - download / viewing of his/her own individual feedback and of feedback to his/her cohort
2 - Instructor - upload, delete, edit of materials/descriptions/day_theme for their location
3 - Admin - upload, delete, edit of materials/descriptions/day_theme for their location(s)
	add, delete edit cohorts, users, & user_level (a.k.a. permissions) for their location(s)
(Possible 4th Super-admin for users/user_level for all locations)
	2 Levels -- Student & Instructor

PAGES 
4 planned
1 - Login/Registration
2 - Materials/Feedback - Student View (download/view only)
3 - Materials/Feedback - Instructor View (for adding / deleting materials, editing descriptions & availability dates)
4 - Edit Courses/Users - add, edit, delete users (name, email, user_level), cohort membership, dates of cohort, locations, etc.

OTHER FUNCTIONALITY?
These would obviously be on an as-time-permitting basis:
Did you want people to be able to post comments/questions in response to the feedback or am I misremembering?
